# Yu-Gi-Oh
An initial creation of a YuGiOh Database with GUI <br/>
This YuGiOh program uses a database with all cards created at the time of creation. <br/>
This is not a completed piece of software but does have current functionality and lets the user search for cards and see descriptions. <br/>
Future improvements are: <br/>
-Create decks within the program <br/>
-Add cards to decks. <br/>
-Update the database with the number of a card in your possession <br/>
This project was written in vb.net. <br />
This was 1 of the first projects I ever wrote. <br />
The program is only basic due to it being a first time experince. It was an experiment to get use to the this progamming language.
